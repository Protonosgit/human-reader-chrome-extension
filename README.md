Human Reader


A chrome extension that uses elevenlabs.io to let you listen to any text on the web. This was a weekend project, so consider it beta. Any feedback or contributions are welcome! The extension is still being reviewed by google, once it's in the chrome extensions store I will post the link here. 

Check out how it works here: TODO: ADD YT LINK
